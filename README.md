# Random Password Guesser

## Overview:
This Python script is designed to demonstrate a simple password guessing mechanism using random selections. It employs the `pyautogui` library to prompt the user for a password input, after which it initiates a guessing loop until the correct password is matched.

## How to Use:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your desired password when prompted.
3. The script will generate random combinations of characters until it matches the input password.
4. Once the correct password is guessed, the script will display the password and the number of iterations it took to guess it.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `pyautogui` library (install via `pip install pyautogui`)

## Usage Notes:
- This script is for educational purposes and should not be used for malicious intent.
- Keep in mind that using random guessing for passwords is highly inefficient and not recommended for real-world scenarios.

## Disclaimer:
The author is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the use of this script. Please use it responsibly and ethically.
